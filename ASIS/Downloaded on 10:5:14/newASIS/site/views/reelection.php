You will get exposed to many things from giving visiting Indonesian high school students a campus tour, raising $75,000 for banquet party, visiting Hong Kong Students Association party to build a rapport with them, attending Alumni dinner in Jakarta, and many more. That one year will give you hone your leadership skill, public speaking skill, and teamwork skill. Please feel free to call me or talk to me more about the details of the role and responsibilities. If I have one more year to spend at USC, I will definitely run again for the position.<br><br>
